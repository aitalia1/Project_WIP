# Working Name: Alzabo
Named after a reference to a book that I like.

STATEMENT:
"Alzabo" is a program that seeks to create dynamic family trees for the purposes of ease of file navigation. Each node is one person and the documents linked to each person are entirely local / client-side. 
This program will not change or modify the current existing files in
any way what-so-ever.
